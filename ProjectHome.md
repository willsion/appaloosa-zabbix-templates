# About #
This project provides high quality templates for [Zabbix](http://www.zabbix.com), a monitoring and trending platform.

We started by adapting the spectacular MySQL templates for cacti from the [mysql-cacti-templates](http://mysql-cacti-templates.googlecode.com) project, and have since added MemcachedTemplates and Bind9Templates. Be sure to check them out.

This project was made possible by a generous sponsorship thanks to [Okta](http://www.okta.com), Powering your Cloud Area Network.

Assistance with installation or customization can be provided by PalominoDB. www.palominodb.com
